.SH "Output"
Upon successful execution, the application will exit with an exit code of 0\. The result will include latency, jitter, download, upload, packet loss (where available), and a result URL\.
.
.P
Latency and jitter will be represented in milliseconds\. Download and upload units will depend on the output format as well as if a unit was specified\. The human\-readable format defaults to Mbps and any machine\-readable formats (csv, tsv, json, jsonl, json\-pretty) use bytes as the unit of measure with max precision\. Packet loss is represented as a percentage, or \fBNot available\fR when packet loss is unavailable in the executing network environment\.
.
.P
The Result URL is available to share your result, appending \fB\.png\fR to the Result URL will create a shareable result image\.

.SH "Network Timeout Values"
By default, network requests set a timeout of \fB10\fR seconds\. The only exception to this is latency testing, which sets a timeout of \fB15\fR seconds\.
.
.SH "Fatal Errors"
Upon fatal errors, the application will exit with a non\-zero exit code\.
.

.SH "SSL Certificate Locations"
By default the following paths are checked for CA certificate bundles on linux machines:
.
.IP "" 4

/etc/ssl/certs/ca\-certificates\.crt
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca\-bundle\.crt
/usr/share/ssl/certs/ca\-bundle\.crt

/etc/ssl/cert\.pem
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If the device under test does \fInot\fR have one of the above mentioned files, then the canonical and up to date CA certificate bundle provided by the curl project can be manually downloaded into a specific location\. This specific location can be provided as a parameter per the following example:
